# REACT REPOSITORY [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebookincubator/create-react-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Hey there!

This is the master branch of my React Repository.

In creating this repository I have adopted same rule, as in previous repositories.

Each branch, represents simple projects.

--------------------------------------------------------

- `to-do-list` -> Be aware that you need to have `Webpack` installed to run it. Run by `npm start`.
- `gif-search-app` -> Wanna search a cat gifs in `giphy`? Thats why you need it for. Run by `npm start`. You will host own server.
