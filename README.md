On this branch - React-Apps, you will find categorized in proper folders, React applications.

All you will have to do is to download the app you are interested in, then open directory with use of commander, and finally type {npm start} (be sure you need to have node.js installed).

--------------------------------------------------------

All is under development, and my-react-app folder is a playground app to test functionality and to learn React.

Further in time, I will push on this branch all the projects made with use of React.

Thanks for your time!
