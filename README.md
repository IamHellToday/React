On this branch - `React-Apps`, you will find categorized in proper folders all my React applications.

To run them, all you will have to do is to download the app you are interested in, then open directory with use of commander and finally, type `npm start` (kepp in mind, that you need to have node.js installed).

You will be redirected directly to `localhost:3000`, because you have just run server on your PC :).

--------------------------------------------------------

All is under development, and my-react-app folder is a playground app to test functionality and to learn React.

Further in time, I will push on this branch all the projects made with use of React.

Thanks for your time!
